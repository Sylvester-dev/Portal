# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
## What we learned
   Imitating the blockchain environment to test
   Build a script to run our contract
1. Using hardhat
1. storing data in blockchain
We,
1. Called our wave function.
2. Changed the state variable.
3. Read the new value of the variable.

So at the end we want to:
1. Let users submit a message along with their wave.
2. Have that data saved somehow on the blockchain.
3. Show that data on our site so anyone can come to see all the people who have waved at us and their messages.
